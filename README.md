# Non-Linear-ML-Models-for-Data-Analytics

* The objective is to design Non-Linear Machine Learning model to predict citations on a research papers in the future. 
* We will be taking into account the number of citations for a paper submitted by researchers from the department and develop a Non-Linear ML Model to fit this data which will be used to predict number of citations their papers would reach in the future.
* In standard analysis of databases, the datasets have linear relationship with one another, in this project we introduce Non-Linear model to have a comprehensive understanding of its performance.

Accuracy: R-Square Value
= 0.9171567260706279
= 91%

* Compared to the accuracy of Decision Trees = 71% , RandomForest showed superior performance in prediction
* Problem of overfitting was resolved since RF produces low variance
